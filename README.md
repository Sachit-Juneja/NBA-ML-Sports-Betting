# NBA-ML-Sports-Betting

This is just a fun side project that I plan on doing during my 1B term. I will be using the following packages in python to do the same:
* Tensorflow - Machine learning library
* XGBoost - Gradient boosting framework
* Numpy - Package for scientific computing in Python
* Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
* Colorama - Color text output
* Tqdm - Progress bars
* Requests - Http library
* Scikit_learn - Machine learning library

I also plan on writing a very basic Flask application to help view the data from this tool in the browser itself. It saves everyone the pain of cloning the repo, running it, making edits and then getting the result.
